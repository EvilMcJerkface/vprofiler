Test whether the clang ast includes function prototypes when it parses a file.  
I.e. if we want to profile std::vector::push_back will the clang ast include
the function prototype for std::vector::push_back.  Also determine how 
templates affect GetQualifiedTypename in clang's api.  Does anything need
to be adjusted to compensate for an unexpected typename on account of clang's
api?

For finding function prototypes problem, the following has a potential solution:
