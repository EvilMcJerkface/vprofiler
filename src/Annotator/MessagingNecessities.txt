Queues:
    - queue created, destroyed
    - pushes, pops to queue

Pipe:
    - pipe created, destroyed.  Need to note association between I/O ends of pipe
    - pushes, pops to pipe

Named FIFO:
    - call to mknod with S_IFIFO in second argument creates FIFO.  Need to track 
      file where fifo_name are the same in following example:
      mknod(<fifo_name>, ...)
      open(<fifo_name>)

Shared Memory:
    - Track shared memory keys to determine whether memory mappings in different 
      processes are to the same shared memory segment
    - Track writes/reads with offset from shm base addr.  Log object address as
      <shm_key>_<mem_offset_from_base>
